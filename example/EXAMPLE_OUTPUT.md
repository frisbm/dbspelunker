### Foreign Key Actions Summary

Summary of ON DELETE behaviors for data safety and archival planning:

| ON DELETE Action | Relationships | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CASCADE | claim\_line → encounter<br>encounter → patient<br>provider\_organization → organization<br>provider\_organization → provider | Deleting parent automatically deletes children |
| RESTRICT | encounter → organization<br>encounter → provider | Cannot delete parent if children exist |

**Data Safety Notes:**
- **CASCADE**: Use caution - deletes propagate automatically
- **RESTRICT**: Safe for data preservation - prevents accidental deletes
- **SET NULL/DEFAULT**: Breaks relationships but preserves child records
- **NO ACTION**: Default PostgreSQL behavior, similar to RESTRICT
